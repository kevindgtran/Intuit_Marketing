### Overview

I Built this project afterwork and on weekends to enhance the marketing & recruiting efforts, I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and github gh-pages. Collaborated with an independent designer for the character and backgound graphics. This fun interactive web page allows users to learn about Intuit, their products and company benefits by seeing animations vs reading an email. Users can click to learn more and email a specific recruiter directly.
